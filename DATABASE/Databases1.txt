List all the titles of the movies in the database.
SELECT title, 
FROM Movies;

List all the titles of the movies in the database in descending order of the year they were released.
SELECT title,
FROM Movies,
ORDER BY year DESC;

Insert a new record into the directors table for Jean-Pierre Jeunet whose country of origin is France. (Note: Assume the column for director_id is auto incremented, so you don't need to put in a value for that column.)
INSERT INTO Directors (first_name, last_name, country),
VALUES ('Jean-Pierre', 'Jeunet', 'France');

List the director_id for Jean-Pierre Jeunet.
SELECT director_id,
FROM Directors,
WHERE last_name='Jeunet';

Insert a new record into the movies table for Amelie
which was released in 2001 and directed by Jean-Pierre Jeunet. 
(Hint: Assume the id you got from the last query was "2" and use that. 
And, like question 3, assume the movie_id column is auto incremented).
INSERT INTO Movies (title, year, director_id),
VALUES ('Amelie', 2001, 3);

List all columns for all records of the directors table in 
ascending alphabetical order of the director's country of origin.
SELECT * FROM Directors,
ORDER BY country;

List the country of origin of the director of Amelie. 
(You could do this using either a join or a subquery. Use a join.)
JOIN Movies,
ON Movies.director_id=directors.director_id,
WHERE title='Amelie';

List all the movies in the database along with each movie's 
director, ordered by the director's last name in ascending order. 
(Hint: you'll want to use a join and choose the columns title, first, and last).
SELECT Movies.title, directors.first_name, directors.last_name, 
FROM Movies,
JOIN Directors,
ON Movies.directo_id=directors.director_id
ORDER BY directors.last_name;
